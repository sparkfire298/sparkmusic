# Using this code
The current code here is outdated. Due to the bot becoming more advanced, I have decided to make the bot closed sourced. This repository is no longer updated.



# Setup

Install:
```npm init -y```
```npm install discord.js@13 @discordjs/voice node-fetch@2.6.9```

**Put your token in info.json** then run:
